# ChessEngine

## Why?

Often for interview purposes I'm asked to implement something around chess. 8-Queens problem or some kind of simulator.
This library is a small subset of "domain code" for implementing Chess.

I've implemented it Kotlin because:

1. Kotlin is cool atm
2. Cross compiling to JVM and JS(if I would interview for frontend roles needed chess)
2. Since its JVM I can use it in Scala <3

## What?

You can find here code implementing logic for the standard chess pieces and basic board.

## What's missing?

 - [ ] Fully immutable Board
 - [ ] Castling
 - [ ] Piece Promotion
 - [ ] En passant
 - [ ] Checkmate(just check for now)
